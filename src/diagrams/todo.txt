- for each canvas, hover somewhere to see graph 

surface fitting
- new design for MAP

- can move in 2 directions at once
- shade the 1std
- change pointer to wasd
- move landmarks to the edge and add planar factors

spring model
- colormap to display spring energy
- svg size and shape
- can choose number of masses
- does it spread internal energy evenly across 3 springs?
- reset natural lengths of springs in set springs mode
