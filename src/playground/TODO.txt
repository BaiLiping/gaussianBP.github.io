1. Select area and duplicate selected graph
    plot area is not very large, too many nodes can cause the beliefs to overlap, bad for visualization
2. Predefined graph templates for selection
3. Message passing animations
4. Show some info while hovering over nodes
    maybe a 3D bell curve visualization of the belief
